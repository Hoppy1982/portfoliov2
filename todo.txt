Bugs
- Changing the char particle speed seems to mess up the final positions

Cautiously fixed bugs..
- build.js fails silently if syntax errors in modules called from home.js


To Do
- Finish chuffing letters library
- Carousel functionality with place holders for nav links
- Change navTargetWord to update from Carousel
- Add function to transfer letter particles to hold particles
- Make it so as carousel highlighted option changes particles automatically move from
nav word into hold pattern, then new particles come in for new word.
- Nav link description to update as carousel rotates.
- Pretty up home.css when all functionality added
- Possibly add lozenge letters from circles idea to roll on on page load for
"Mark Hopcraft"
- Make particles & connecting lines scale with canvas size.


Cautiously done..
- Add support for multiple lines of text in the navTargetWord. Max 12 chars per line.

Bugs
- build.js fails silently if syntax errors in modules called from home.js


To Do
- Add support for multiple lines of text in the navTargetWord. Max 4 lines, words
split evenly over lines and centered??
- Finish chuffing letters library
- Carousel functionality with place holders for nav links
- Change navTargetWord to update from Carousel
- Add function to transfer letter particles to hold particles
- Make it so as carousel highlighted option changes particles automatically move from
nav word into hold pattern, then new particles come in for new word.
- Nav link description to update as carousel rotates.
